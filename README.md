# MultiPliers

MultiPliers is a WIP language inspired by multiple other languages. It's a rewrite and rework of [LuauScript](https://github.com/SiideCode/LuauScript), except with a focus to become multi-purpose in the future, and to not leave it attached only to the limited ecosystem of Roblox.

## The goal

MultiPliers has multiple goals to accomplish, however it might not accomplish **all** of them in the end. I will write more about the goals later somewhere else, because what I have in my mind right now got too big for a readme, so it's pretty much blogpost-worthy.
