# MultiPliers

MultiPliers is a WIP language inspired by multiple other languages, but primarily based on [Haxe](https://haxe.org). It's a rewrite and rework of [LuauScript](https://github.com/SiideCode/LuauScript), except with plans to become multi-purpose in the future, and to not leave it attached only to the limited ecosystem of Roblox.

## Current development focus/goals

Current focus of the project is porting the LuauScript lexer (with some improvements) to Haxe.

## The goal

MultiPliers has multiple goals to accomplish, however it might not accomplish **all** of them in the end, because the scope might change, and it's technically my first programming language. The goals will be properly stated later (whenever I feel like it).
