// TODO: think about add a partial parse: only parses things that are whitelisted or not blacklisted, the rest is skipped.
// minimises the time needed to parse IF we need, for example, to only know bounds of a certain function, or execute a certain function, or whatever, idk.
// TODO: consider some process to convert AST back into source code?
